# aqueue

![demo](docs/demo.gif)

An async queue with live progress display. Good for running and visualizing "tree-like" processing
jobs, such as website scrapes.

## Example

```python
import random

import trio

from aqueue import EnqueueFn, ProgressDisplay, run_queue, Item


# the top-level item. it makes more items dynamically.
class RootItem(Item):
    async def process(
        self, enqueue: EnqueueFn, progress_display: ProgressDisplay
    ) -> None:
        num_children = 3
        # update the display
        progress_display.update_worker_desc("Making child items")
        progress_display.set_overall_total(num_children)

        # create some children items
        for _ in range(num_children):
            await trio.sleep(random.random())
            # call the provided enqueue function
            await enqueue(ChildItem())


# a dynamically created item
class ChildItem(Item):
    async def process(
        self, enqueue: EnqueueFn, progress_display: ProgressDisplay
    ) -> None:
        progress_display.update_worker_desc("Doing work...")
        await trio.sleep(random.random())


def main() -> None:
    run_queue(
        initial_items=[RootItem()],  # set the first item to kick things off
        num_workers=2,  # run with 2 workers
    )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Usage Notes

- This library is fully docstringed and type-annotated ðŸ¥³
- Any item can create more items.
- The "items" you can process are objects that must have an async `process` method (see source for
  exact signature). If you'd like, your item class can inherit from `aqueue.Item`, which defines
  this as an abstractmethod, but you don't have to.
- If you want to share some state, set a global variable or use a
  [`ContextVar`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextvars.html).
- All async primitives used inside items must be compatible with
  [Trio](https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).
- All the terminal visualization is provided by [Rich](https://rich.readthedocs.io/). Additionally,
  the arguments to `overall_progress_columns` of `aqueue.run_queue()` are Rich objects.
