    Process all items in ``initial_items`` (and any subsequent items they enqueue) until
    they are complete. Meanwhile, display a terminal visualization of it.

    This function runs an `asyncio` event loop, which is the default provided by `AnyIO
    <https://anyio.readthedocs.io>`_. Use `async_run_queue` if you want to use a
    different event loop.

    .. code-block:: python

        import aqueue

        class MyItem(aqueue.Item):
            async def process(self):
                pass

        aqueue.run_queue(
            initial_items=[MyItem()],
        )

    :param initial_items: An iterable that seeds the queue. This is where the top-level
        item(s) should go that produces more items.

    :param num_workers: Specifies how many workers will be running concurrently.

        .. note::

           Setting a high ``num_workers`` does not automatically mean your program will
           run faster.

    :param order: Can be either of:

        - ``lifo`` for last-in-first-out processing, or depth-first. This is recommended
          for website scraping because it yields your deepest items fast, which are
          probably what you're really after (versus ``fifo`` that processes intermediate
          items first). This is the default.

        - ``fifo`` for first-in-first-out processing, or breadth-first.

        - ``priority`` for priority-based processing. In this case, processing will
          occur by *ascending* `Item.priority` (smallest first).

        .. note::

            ``priority`` only guarantees that workers will select items from the queue
            according to priority. It does not guarantee that items will be completed in
            any order.

        The type for this argument is aliased by `aqueue.Ordering`.

    :param graceful_ctrl_c: specifies whether pressing Ctrl-C will stop things abruptly
        (`False`) or wait until all items being processed by workers are finished first
        (`True`, the default).

        .. warning::

           If you write a buggy item that never finishes, Ctrl-C will have no effect.
